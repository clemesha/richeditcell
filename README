Rich Edit Cell - Syntax Highlighting, etc for codenode cells
============================================================

This code represents a first exploration of adding 
rich editing functionality (most importantly: code syntax highlighting)
to the cells of codenode.

It uses "EditArea" (http://www.cdolivet.com/index.php?page=editArea),
which I like for 2 reasons:
1) It is very complete looking, and the docs are solid:
http://www.cdolivet.com/editarea/editarea/docs/
2)There is a plugin mechanism:
